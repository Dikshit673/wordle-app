# Wordle Web App

## Overview

Wordle is a word-based game app that challenges users to find a five-letter word in six attempts or less. After each guess, the app provides feedback in the form of colored tiles, indicating which letters are correct and in the correct position.

## Features

- **Daily Word**: A new five-letter word is generated every day, providing a fresh challenge for users.
- **Six Attempts**: Users have six chances to guess the daily word, with feedback provided after each attempt.
- **Colored Tiles**: Correct letters in the correct position are highlighted in green, while correct letters in incorrect positions are highlighted in yellow.
- **Incorrect Letters**: Letters that are not in the daily word are highlighted in gray.
<!-- * **Statistics**: Users can view their win/loss record and average number of attempts per game. -->

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Built using React.js, allowing for a seamless user experience across Browser.
- **Backend**: Powered by a Node.js server, utilizing a MongoDB database to store user statistics and daily words.
- **Word Generation**: Daily words are generated using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms.
